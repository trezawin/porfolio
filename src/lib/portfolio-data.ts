  blurb: `Hi, 
I'm an AI and data science enthusiast who loves turning ideas into real, useful intelligent systems. After more than a decade building travel-tech solutions at Amadeus, I decided to deepen my data skills through an M.Sc. in Big Data & Business Analytics at ESCP. 
These days, I'm exploring how AI and large language models can make technology smarter and more trustworthy like building LLM-powered tools for smart-contract auditing. I'm always curious, learning, and excited about what data can do next.`,
